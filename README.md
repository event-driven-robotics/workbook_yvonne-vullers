# workbook_yvonne-vullers
In this repository you can find all the code I used for the eye-tracking project. Below, the contents of the folders are explained.
Additionally, the paper ([pdf](Internship_Report_Yvonne_Vullers.pdf) & [source code](Internship_Report_Yvonne_Vullers.zip)) are included in the repo.

## ellipse_code
In here you find the code for the eye-tracking as described in the [paper](Internship_Report_Yvonne_Vullers.pdf).
For the eye tracking, the [27 users dataset](https://github.com/aangelopoulos/event_based_gaze_tracking) is used.

## create_ellipse
In here you find code for trying out functionalities for the eye tracking code. 

## evaluation 
In here you find python notebooks to evaluate the tracking results
