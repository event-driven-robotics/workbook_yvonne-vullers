# CREATE_ELLIPSE

## create_ellipse
In this file I played around with creating the templates and finding the eye center (make_template(), makeEllipse()) and the eyelids (points(), eyelid()).

The points() function returns all the points on an arc defining an eyelid. These points can later be used to fit a polynomial to define the eyelid.
